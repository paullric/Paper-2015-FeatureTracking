	Abstract = {Abstract Composites of wind speeds, equivalent potential temperature, mean sea level pressure, vertical velocity, and relative humidity have been produced for the 100 most intense extratropical cyclones in the Northern Hemisphere winter for the 40-yr ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA-40) and the high resolution global environment model (HiGEM). Features of conceptual models of cyclone structure?the warm conveyor belt, cold conveyor belt, and dry intrusion?have been identified in the composites from ERA-40 and compared to HiGEM. Such features can be identified in the composite fields despite the smoothing that occurs in the compositing process. The surface features and the three-dimensional structure of the cyclones in HiGEM compare very well with those from ERA-40. The warm conveyor belt is identified in the temperature and wind fields as a mass of warm air undergoing moist isentropic uplift and is very similar in ERA-40 and HiGEM. The rate of ascent is lower in HiGEM, associated with a shallower slope of the moist isentropes in the warm sector. There are also differences in the relative humidity fields in the warm conveyor belt. In ERA-40, the high values of relative humidity are strongly associated with the moist isentropic uplift, whereas in HiGEM these are not so strongly associated. The cold conveyor belt is identified as rearward flowing air that undercuts the warm conveyor belt and produces a low-level jet, and is very similar in HiGEM and ERA-40. The dry intrusion is identified in the 500-hPa vertical velocity and relative humidity. The structure of the dry intrusion compares well between HiGEM and ERA-40 but the descent is weaker in HiGEM because of weaker along-isentrope flow behind the composite cyclone. HiGEM?s ability to represent the key features of extratropical cyclone structure can give confidence in future predictions from this model.},

@article{hoskins2002stormtracks,
	Abstract = {Abstract The aim of this paper is to explore the use of both an Eulerian and system-centered method of storm track diagnosis applied to a wide range of meteorological fields at multiple levels to provide a range of perspectives on the Northern Hemisphere winter transient motions and to give new insight into the storm track organization and behavior. The data used are primarily from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts reanalyses project extended with operational analyses to the period 1979?2000. This is supplemented by data from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction and Goddard Earth Observing System 1 reanalyses. The range of fields explored include the usual mean sea level pressure and the lower- and upper-tropospheric height, meridional wind, vorticity, and temperature, as well as the potential vorticity (PV) on a 330-K isentropic surface (PV330) and potential temperature on a PV = 2 PVU surface (?PV2). As well as reporting the primary analysis based on feature tracking, the standard Eulerian 2?6-day bandpass filtered variance analysis is also reported and contrasted with the tracking diagnostics. To enable the feature points to be identified as extrema for all the chosen fields, a planetary wave background structure is removed at each data time. The bandpass filtered variance derived from the different fields yield a rich picture of the nature and comparative magnitudes of the North Pacific and Atlantic storm tracks, and of the Siberian and Mediterranean candidates for storm tracks. The feature tracking allows the cyclonic and anticyclonic activities to be considered seperately. The analysis indicates that anticyclonic features are generally much weaker with less coherence than the cyclonic systems. Cyclones and features associated with them are shown to have much greater coherence and give tracking diagnostics that create a vivid storm track picture that includes the aspects highlighted by the variances as well as highlighting aspects that are not readily available from Eulerian studies. In particular, the upper-tropospheric features as shown by negative ?PV2, for example, occur in a band spiraling around the hemisphere from the subtropical North Atlantic eastward to the high latitudes of the same ocean basin. Lower-troposphere storm tracks occupy more limited longitudinal sectors, with many of the individual storms possibly triggered from the upper-tropospheric disturbances in the spiral band of activity.},

@article{caron2013relationship,
	Abstract = {We compare two 28-year simulations performed with two versions of the Global Environmental Multiscale model run in variable-resolution mode. The two versions differ only by small differences in their radiation scheme. The most significant modification introduced is a reduction in the ice effective radius, which is observed to increase absorption of upwelling infrared radiation and increase temperature in the upper troposphere. The resulting change in vertical lapse rate is then observed to drive a resolution-dependent response of convection, which in turn modifies the zonal circulation and induces significant changes in simulated Atlantic tropical cyclone activity. The resulting change in vertical lapse rate and its implication in the context of anthropogenic climate change are discussed.},

	Abstract = {AbstractA novel tropical cyclone (TC) detection technique designed for coarse-resolution models is tested and evaluated. The detector, based on the Okubo?Weiss?Zeta parameter (OWZP), is applied to a selection of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, phase 3 (CMIP3), models {$[$}Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation Mark, version 3.5 (CSIRO-Mk3.5); Max Planck Institute ECHAM5 (MPI-ECHAM5); and Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Climate Model, versions 2.0 (GFDL CM2.0) and 2.1 (GFDL CM2.1){$]$}, and the combined performance of the model and detector is assessed by comparison with observed TC climatology for the period 1970?2000. Preliminary TC frequency projections are made using the three better-performing models by comparing the detected TC climatologies between the late twentieth and late twenty-first centuries. Very reasonable TC formation climatologies were detected in CSIRO-Mk3.5, MPI-ECHAM5, and GFDL CM2.1 for most basins, with the exception of the North Atlantic, where a large underdetection was present in all models. The GFDL CM2.0 model was excluded from the projection study because of a systematic underdetection in all basins. The above detection problems have been reported in other published studies, which suggests model rather than detector limitations are mostly responsible. This study demonstrates that coarse-resolution climate models do in general produce TC-like circulations with realistic geographical and seasonal distributions detectable by the OWZP TC detector. The preliminary projection results are consistent with the published literature, based on higher-resolution studies, of a global reduction of TCs between about 6{\%} and 20{\%}, with a much larger spread of results (about +20{\%} to ?50{\%}) in individual basins.},

@article{tory2013tracking,
	Abstract = {AbstractA novel approach to tropical cyclone (TC) detection in coarse-resolution numerical model data is introduced and assessed. This approach differs from traditional detectors in two main ways. First, it was developed and tuned using 20 yr of ECMWF Interim Re-Analysis (ERA-Interim) data, rather than using climate model data. This ensures that the detector is independent of any climate models to which it will later be applied. Second, only relatively large-scale parameters resolvable in climate models are included, in order to minimize any grid-resolution dependence on parameter thresholds. This approach is taken in an attempt to construct a unified TC detection procedure applicable to all climate models without the need for any further tuning or adjustment.Unlike traditional detectors that seek to identify TCs directly, the authors' method seeks to identify conditions favorable for TC formation. Favorable TC formation regions at the center of closed circulations in the lower troposphere to the midtroposphere are identified using a low-deformation vorticity parameter. Additional relative and specific humidity thresholds are applied to ensure the thermodynamic environment is favorable, and a vertical wind shear threshold is applied to eliminate storms in a destructive shear environment. A further requirement is that thresholds for all parameters must be satisfied for at least 48 h before a TC is deemed to have developed.A thorough assessment of the detector performance is provided. It is demonstrated that the method reproduces realistic TC genesis frequency and spatial distributions in the ERA-Interim data. Application of the detector to four climate models is presented in a companion paper.},

@article{auyeung2012regcm,
	Abstract = {This study investigates the potential use of a regional climate model in forecasting seasonal tropical cyclone (TC) activity. A modified version of Regional Climate Model Version 3 (RegCM3) is used to examine the ability of the model to simulate TC genesis and landfalling TC tracks for the active TC season in the western North Pacific. In the model, a TC is identified as a vortex satisfying several conditions, including local maximum relative vorticity at 850 hPa with a value ≥450 {\texttimes} 10−6 s−1, and the temperature at 300 hPa being 1{\textdegree}C higher than the average temperature within 15{\textdegree} latitude radius from the TC center. Tracks are traced by following these found vortices. Six-month ensemble (8 members each) simulations are performed for each year from 1982 to 2001 so that the climatology of the model can be compared to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) observed best-track dataset. The 20-year ensemble experiments show that the RegCM3 can be used to simulate vortices with a wind structure and temperature profile similar to those of real TCs. The model also reproduces tracks very similar to those observed with features like genesis in the tropics, recurvature at higher latitudes and landfall/decay. The similarity of the 500-hPa geopotential height patterns between RegCM3 and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts 40 Year Re-analysis (ERA-40) shows that the model can simulate the subtropical high to a large extent. The simulated climatological monthly spatial distributions as well as the interannual variability of TC occurrence are also similar to the JTWC data. These results imply the possibility of producing seasonal forecasts of tropical cyclones using real-time global climate model predictions as boundary conditions for the RegCM3.},

	Abstract = {This study evaluates the potential use of the regional climate model version 3 (RegCM3) driven by (1) the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) data during 1982--2001 and (2) the NCEP Climate Forecast System Version 2 (CFS2) hindcast data during 2000--2010 in forecasting Western North Pacific (WNP) tropical cyclone (TC) activity. The first experiment is conducted to investigate the ability of the model in generating a good climatology of TC activity in spatial and temporal scales, so the model could be used in the second experiment to test its ability in forecasting TC genesis and landfall. Both experiments extend through the May to October WNP-TC season. Results show that the use of RegCM3 driven by the CFSR achieves a better simulation on the temporal and spatial variation of WNP-TC genesis during 1982--2001, as compared to previous studies using the same model but driven by the ERA40 reanalysis. In addition, diagnoses on the use of RegCM3 driven by the CFS2 point out that the 2000--2010 WNP-TC genesis locations and numbers from the model are very similar to those from the observations. The skill of RegCM3 in the forecasts of landfalling TCs is higher over the Southeast Asian region than over the other sub-regions of East Asia. Potential causes for such regional differences are discussed. Most importantly, statistical analyses show that the use of RegCM3 driven by the CFS2 gives a better forecast skill than the use of CFS2 alone for the prediction of WNP-TCs making landfall in East Asia. This indicates that the use of a dynamical downscaling method for the global forecast data would likely lead to a higher forecast skill of regional TC landfalls in most of the East Asian region.},

@article{harris2016hiram,
	Abstract = {AbstractAn analytic Schmidt transformation is used to create locally refined global model grids capable of efficient climate simulation with gridcell widths as small as 10 km in the GFDL High-Resolution Atmosphere Model (HiRAM). This method of grid stretching produces a grid that varies very gradually into the region of enhanced resolution without changing the topology of the model grid and does not require radical changes to the solver. AMIP integrations were carried out with two grids stretched to 10-km minimum gridcell width: one centered over East Asia and the western Pacific warm pool, and the other over the continental United States. Robust improvements to orographic precipitation, the diurnal cycle of warm-season continental precipitation, and tropical cyclone maximum intensity were found in the region of enhanced resolution, compared to 25-km uniform-resolution HiRAM. The variations in grid size were not found to create apparent grid artifacts, and in some measures the global-mean climate improved in the stretched-grid simulations. In the enhanced-resolution regions, the number of tropical cyclones was reduced, but the fraction of storms reaching hurricane intensity increased, compared to a uniform-resolution simulation. This behavior was also found in a stretched-grid perpetual-September aquaplanet simulation with 12-km resolution over a part of the tropics. Furthermore, the stretched-grid aquaplanet simulation was also largely free of grid artifacts except for an artificial Walker-type circulation, and simulated an ITCZ in its unrefined region more resembling that of higher-resolution aquaplanet simulations, implying that the unrefined region may also be improved in stretched-grid simulations. The improvements due to stretching are attributable to improved resolution as these stretched-grid simulations were sparingly tuned.},

@article{vitart2003mozambique,
	Abstract = {Abstract The 2000 tropical cyclone season over the South Indian Ocean (SIO) was exceptional in terms of tropical cyclone landfall over Mozambique. Observed data suggest that SIO tropical cyclones have a track significantly more zonal during a La Ni{\~n}a event and tend to be more frequent when local SSTs are warmer. The combination of both conditions happened during the 2000 SIO tropical cyclone season and may explain the exceptional number of tropical cyclone landfalls over Mozambique during that season. A set of experiments using an atmospheric model of fairly high resolution (TL159, with a Gaussian grid spacing of 1.125$\,^{\circ}$) forced by prescribed SSTs confirms the role of La Ni{\~n}a conditions and warmer local SSTs on the frequency of tropical cyclone landfalls over Mozambique. This also suggests that a numerical model can simulate the mechanisms responsible for the exceptional 2000 tropical cyclone season, and therefore could be used to explicitly predict the risk of landfall over Mozambique. A coupled model with a TL159 atmospheric component has been integrated for 3 months starting on 1 January of each year 1987?2001 to test this hypothesis. The hindcast produces significantly more tropical cyclone landfalls in 2000 than in any other year, and years with a predicted high risk of landfall generally coincide with years of observed tropical cyclone landfall.},

@article{Walsh2015CLIVAR,
	Abstract = {Abstract While a quantitative climate theory of tropical cyclone formation remains elusive, considerable progress has been made recently in our ability to simulate tropical cyclone climatologies and understand the relationship between climate and tropical cyclone formation. Climate models are now able to simulate a realistic rate of global tropical cyclone formation, although simulation of the Atlantic tropical cyclone climatology remains challenging unless horizontal resolutions finer than 50 km are employed. This article summarizes published research from the idealized experiments of the Hurricane Working Group of U.S. CLIVAR (CLImate VARiability and predictability of the ocean-atmosphere system). This work, combined with results from other model simulations, has strengthened relationships between tropical cyclone formation rates and climate variables such as mid-tropospheric vertical velocity, with decreased climatological vertical velocities leading to decreased tropical cyclone formation. Systematic differences are shown between experiments in which only sea surface temperature is increased versus experiments where only atmospheric carbon dioxide is increased, with the carbon dioxide experiments more likely to demonstrate the decrease in tropical cyclone numbers previously shown to be a common response of climate models in a warmer climate. Experiments where the two effects are combined also show decreases in numbers, but these tend to be less for models that demonstrate a strong tropical cyclone response to increased sea surface temperatures. Further experiments are proposed that may improve our understanding of the relationship between climate and tropical cyclone formation, including experiments with two-way interaction between the ocean and the atmosphere and variations in atmospheric aerosols.},
