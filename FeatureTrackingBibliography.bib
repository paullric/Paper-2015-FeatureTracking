	Abstract = {This study investigates the potential use of a regional climate model in forecasting seasonal tropical cyclone (TC) activity. A modified version of Regional Climate Model Version 3 (RegCM3) is used to examine the ability of the model to simulate TC genesis and landfalling TC tracks for the active TC season in the western North Pacific. In the model, a TC is identified as a vortex satisfying several conditions, including local maximum relative vorticity at 850 hPa with a value ≥450 {\texttimes} 10−6 s−1, and the temperature at 300 hPa being 1{\textdegree}C higher than the average temperature within 15{\textdegree} latitude radius from the TC center. Tracks are traced by following these found vortices. Six-month ensemble (8 members each) simulations are performed for each year from 1982 to 2001 so that the climatology of the model can be compared to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) observed best-track dataset. The 20-year ensemble experiments show that the RegCM3 can be used to simulate vortices with a wind structure and temperature profile similar to those of real TCs. The model also reproduces tracks very similar to those observed with features like genesis in the tropics, recurvature at higher latitudes and landfall/decay. The similarity of the 500-hPa geopotential height patterns between RegCM3 and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts 40 Year Re-analysis (ERA-40) shows that the model can simulate the subtropical high to a large extent. The simulated climatological monthly spatial distributions as well as the interannual variability of TC occurrence are also similar to the JTWC data. These results imply the possibility of producing seasonal forecasts of tropical cyclones using real-time global climate model predictions as boundary conditions for the RegCM3.},

	Abstract = {This study evaluates the potential use of the regional climate model version 3 (RegCM3) driven by (1) the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) data during 1982--2001 and (2) the NCEP Climate Forecast System Version 2 (CFS2) hindcast data during 2000--2010 in forecasting Western North Pacific (WNP) tropical cyclone (TC) activity. The first experiment is conducted to investigate the ability of the model in generating a good climatology of TC activity in spatial and temporal scales, so the model could be used in the second experiment to test its ability in forecasting TC genesis and landfall. Both experiments extend through the May to October WNP-TC season. Results show that the use of RegCM3 driven by the CFSR achieves a better simulation on the temporal and spatial variation of WNP-TC genesis during 1982--2001, as compared to previous studies using the same model but driven by the ERA40 reanalysis. In addition, diagnoses on the use of RegCM3 driven by the CFS2 point out that the 2000--2010 WNP-TC genesis locations and numbers from the model are very similar to those from the observations. The skill of RegCM3 in the forecasts of landfalling TCs is higher over the Southeast Asian region than over the other sub-regions of East Asia. Potential causes for such regional differences are discussed. Most importantly, statistical analyses show that the use of RegCM3 driven by the CFS2 gives a better forecast skill than the use of CFS2 alone for the prediction of WNP-TCs making landfall in East Asia. This indicates that the use of a dynamical downscaling method for the global forecast data would likely lead to a higher forecast skill of regional TC landfalls in most of the East Asian region.},

@article{harris2016hiram,
	Abstract = {AbstractAn analytic Schmidt transformation is used to create locally refined global model grids capable of efficient climate simulation with gridcell widths as small as 10 km in the GFDL High-Resolution Atmosphere Model (HiRAM). This method of grid stretching produces a grid that varies very gradually into the region of enhanced resolution without changing the topology of the model grid and does not require radical changes to the solver. AMIP integrations were carried out with two grids stretched to 10-km minimum gridcell width: one centered over East Asia and the western Pacific warm pool, and the other over the continental United States. Robust improvements to orographic precipitation, the diurnal cycle of warm-season continental precipitation, and tropical cyclone maximum intensity were found in the region of enhanced resolution, compared to 25-km uniform-resolution HiRAM. The variations in grid size were not found to create apparent grid artifacts, and in some measures the global-mean climate improved in the stretched-grid simulations. In the enhanced-resolution regions, the number of tropical cyclones was reduced, but the fraction of storms reaching hurricane intensity increased, compared to a uniform-resolution simulation. This behavior was also found in a stretched-grid perpetual-September aquaplanet simulation with 12-km resolution over a part of the tropics. Furthermore, the stretched-grid aquaplanet simulation was also largely free of grid artifacts except for an artificial Walker-type circulation, and simulated an ITCZ in its unrefined region more resembling that of higher-resolution aquaplanet simulations, implying that the unrefined region may also be improved in stretched-grid simulations. The improvements due to stretching are attributable to improved resolution as these stretched-grid simulations were sparingly tuned.},

@article{vitart2003mozambique,
	Abstract = {Abstract The 2000 tropical cyclone season over the South Indian Ocean (SIO) was exceptional in terms of tropical cyclone landfall over Mozambique. Observed data suggest that SIO tropical cyclones have a track significantly more zonal during a La Ni{\~n}a event and tend to be more frequent when local SSTs are warmer. The combination of both conditions happened during the 2000 SIO tropical cyclone season and may explain the exceptional number of tropical cyclone landfalls over Mozambique during that season. A set of experiments using an atmospheric model of fairly high resolution (TL159, with a Gaussian grid spacing of 1.125$\,^{\circ}$) forced by prescribed SSTs confirms the role of La Ni{\~n}a conditions and warmer local SSTs on the frequency of tropical cyclone landfalls over Mozambique. This also suggests that a numerical model can simulate the mechanisms responsible for the exceptional 2000 tropical cyclone season, and therefore could be used to explicitly predict the risk of landfall over Mozambique. A coupled model with a TL159 atmospheric component has been integrated for 3 months starting on 1 January of each year 1987?2001 to test this hypothesis. The hindcast produces significantly more tropical cyclone landfalls in 2000 than in any other year, and years with a predicted high risk of landfall generally coincide with years of observed tropical cyclone landfall.},

@article{Walsh2015CLIVAR,
	Abstract = {Abstract While a quantitative climate theory of tropical cyclone formation remains elusive, considerable progress has been made recently in our ability to simulate tropical cyclone climatologies and understand the relationship between climate and tropical cyclone formation. Climate models are now able to simulate a realistic rate of global tropical cyclone formation, although simulation of the Atlantic tropical cyclone climatology remains challenging unless horizontal resolutions finer than 50 km are employed. This article summarizes published research from the idealized experiments of the Hurricane Working Group of U.S. CLIVAR (CLImate VARiability and predictability of the ocean-atmosphere system). This work, combined with results from other model simulations, has strengthened relationships between tropical cyclone formation rates and climate variables such as mid-tropospheric vertical velocity, with decreased climatological vertical velocities leading to decreased tropical cyclone formation. Systematic differences are shown between experiments in which only sea surface temperature is increased versus experiments where only atmospheric carbon dioxide is increased, with the carbon dioxide experiments more likely to demonstrate the decrease in tropical cyclone numbers previously shown to be a common response of climate models in a warmer climate. Experiments where the two effects are combined also show decreases in numbers, but these tend to be less for models that demonstrate a strong tropical cyclone response to increased sea surface temperatures. Further experiments are proposed that may improve our understanding of the relationship between climate and tropical cyclone formation, including experiments with two-way interaction between the ocean and the atmosphere and variations in atmospheric aerosols.},
